The rating for a sandwich with 5 pieces of roast beef and 0 tablespoons of peanut butter is about 8

The rating for a sandwich with 5 pieces of roast beef and 5 tablespoons of peanut butter is about 12

The rating that could be trusted is the sandwich with no peanut butter because the rating is less than 11. The 
rating that can't be trusted is the sandwich with both roast beef and peanut butter and that's because it has a 
rating greater than 10, even though the rating was supposed to be out of 10. This is possible because the 
coefficients are after all just a number, and since the rating increase in a linear manner, it won't ever "cap off"
at 10.
